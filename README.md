# 👋 Hi, I'm shashank

I build **agentic automation systems**—LLMs that *decide*, workflows that *execute*, and APIs/webhooks that keep everything moving.

Right now I’m focused on:
- **Agentic AI**: planning → tool-use → feedback loops → reliable outcomes
- **n8n orchestration**: webhooks, retries, error routing, human-in-the-loop where needed
- **Claude + Codex workflows**: using LLMs for reasoning, codegen, and operational automation
- **Java + Python**: backend logic, integration glue, and data/ML when needed

---

## ⚙️ What I build

### 🧠 Agentic Systems (LLM as the decision layer)
- Tool calling + structured outputs (JSON-first)
- Multi-step reasoning loops (plan, act, verify)
- Guardrails via validation, constraints, and fallback paths (not vibes)

### 🔁 Workflow Automation (n8n)
- Webhook-driven automations
- Exception handling pipelines
- State passing + branching + idempotent actions
- API integrations (ERP-like mocks, carriers, databases, spreadsheets)

---

## 🧩 Current focus
- **SupplyMate** — a supply chain “control tower” style automation system  
  *Autonomously resolves exceptions by orchestrating real-time data flow + LLM reasoning loops + next-best-action execution.*

- **Pharmate** — an agentic research copilot (multi-agent, adapters, retrieval, structured reasoning)

---

## 🛠️ Tech stack

**Automation / Agents**
- n8n, webhooks, REST APIs
- Claude, Codex (LLM reasoning + code generation)
- JSON structured outputs, tool calling, prompt+schema patterns

**Languages**
- **Java** (backend, OOP, collections, services)
- **Python** (automation scripts, APIs, ML/LLM glue)

**Also comfortable with**
- Git/GitHub workflows
- Docker/WSL-based dev setups
- Databases + API testing + integration patterns

---

## 🧠 How I think about building agentic systems
- **AI decides, workflows execute.**
- Prefer **deterministic edges**: schemas, validators, retries, audits.
- Design for **observability**: logs, traces, error routes, replayability.

## 🤝 Let’s collaborate
If you’re building something involving **agents**, **n8n**, or **LLM-powered automation**, I’m always down to jam.
